IMPORTANT :
===========

These Nighthawk Carbon presets are identical to the Nighthawk Wood presets.

As of today, Oratory1990 and others haven't measured the Nighthawk Carbon, only the Nighthawk Wood. But Oratory1990 measurements are the most accurate to date.

Both headphones are strictly identical, except for the pads :
- The Nighthawk Wood has one pair of hybrid pads (mostly pleather)
- The Nighthawk Carbon has two pairs of pads (first pair pleather, second pair fabric)

Therefore it's better to use the Nighthawk Wood Oratory preset as a basis for the Nighthawk Carbon, and then adjust the filters to your liking to compensate for the different pads.
